rene magritte: melting clocks beneath a bowler-hat sky, where clouds whisper secrets to apple-faced men in suits amidst a desert of floating boulders.
Through a kaleidoscope lens, a bicycle pedals on its own, its wheels spinning patterns of infinity under a canopy of levitating fish, while trees bend to whisper their dreams into the ears of giant snails, casting shadows over a chessboard where knights and pawns ponder the meaning of freedom.
In a liminal space where time drips like honey from a ceiling of stars, a staircase coils into itself, defying gravity, leading to doorways that open into the sea. Mirrors reflect the sound of colors as pianos play themselves, their keys unlocking the rhythm of the universe. A solitary figure dances on the edge of an umbrella, balancing precariously over a city where buildings breathe and windows blink open into other dimensions. Elephants parade on spiderwebs, their silhouettes painting stories on the moon, while whispered echoes from an unseen crowd leave footprints in the sky, tracing constellations named after forgotten dreams.
In a garden where shadows hum and flowers bloom with the glow of neon, a cat wearing a monocle reads the newspaper, its pages fluttering with tales of underwater cities and skies sewn with silk. Lanterns float, lighting the path for paper boats on a river that flows upward, carrying messages between the stars. A clock with liquid hands marks time in a symphony of whispers, while bicycles with butterfly wings soar over a landscape of crystal mountains. In the air, a tapestry weaves itself from the laughter of invisible audiences, creating bridges that connect the dreams of sleeping poets. A single tree grows in the center, bearing fruits that hold the secrets of the universe, guarded by dragons with feathers like ink, sketching destinies on the canvas of the night.
