supernova explosion
galaxy and star formation
cosmic filaments connecting different regions of the universe
Interstellar nursery cradling infant stars,
Quantum echoes ripple through the void, stitching time's fabric with starlight threads, as nebulae whisper secrets of creation in the cosmic dance of gravitational ballet.
